                <h2>IndT 474: Mechatronics Systems</h2>

                <h3>Course Description</h3>
                <p>Mechatronics is a multi-disciplinary engineering discipline representing a synergistic combination of mechanical, electrical, control, and computer engineering, all integrated through a design process. The course provides a cross-disciplinary study of mechatronics systems at a theoretical and practical level. The emphasis is on a balanced approach to: (1) theoretical and analytical understanding of the fundamentals of mechatronics system design, and (2) practical implementation of learned concepts. Software and hardware simulation and interfacing is studied and reinforced through a set of assignments, lab exercises, and a project, based on the Lego Mindstorm EV3 kit.</p>

                <h3>Course Scope</h3>
                <p>The course studies the fundamentals of mechatronics systems. Topics to be covered include: principles of systems modeling, interfacing and signal conditioning of sensors and actuators; data acquisition and signal processing; systems control; overview of robotics and computer vision.</p>

                <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
                <p>After the completion of the course the students should demonstrate the ability to:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Understand the mechanical, electrical and control aspects of mechatronics systems.</li>
                    <li>Identify various mechatronics systems and their primary components.</li>
                    <li>Understand the fundamentals of electro-mechanical sensors and be able to apply engineering principles to interpret data from electromechanical sensors.</li>
                    <li>Identify different classes of actuators, including DC motors, AC motors, step motors, hydraulic and pneumatic actuators.</li>
                    <li>Understand functioning of A/D and D/A convertors and recognize their limitations.</li>
                    <li>Understand the digital implementation of control, and design basic digital control techniques.</li>
                    <li>Understand the mechatronics system integration and be able to apply it to different physical systems.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Course Materials</h3>

                <h3>Topics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction to Mechatronics Systems</li>
                    <li>Actuators, Modeling and Overview</li>
                    <li>Sensors, Modeling and Overview</li>
                    <li>Mechatronics Systems Modeling and Design</li>
                    <li>Data Acquisition and Signal Processing</li>
                    <li>Control Systems</li>
                    <li>Microcontrollers and Microprocessors</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Evaluation Procedure</h3>
                <p>There are two homework assignments and two in-class quizzes. There are four practical labs in the course. The students are expected to submit a lab report within one week of the lab practice. The course requires participation in a team project, with an objective of building a manipulator using the Lego Mindstorms EV3 kit, and programming the manipulator to perform a pick-and-place task for relocating an object to a desired location.</p>
