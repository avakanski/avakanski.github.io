                <h2>IndT 457: Lean to Green Sustainable Technology</h2>

                <h3>Course Description</h3>
                <p>Lean production and lean manufacturing refer to the use of systematic methods to reduce costs by eliminating wastes and nonvalue-added activities, while delivering customer demands on time. Even without explicitly targeting environmental outcomes, lean efforts can yield substantial environmental benefits.</p>

                <h3>Course Scope</h3>
                <p>The course addresses lean principles and practices as applied primarily in manufacturing processes, as well as other work-related processes. Energy efficient building design is addressed. Trade-offs associated with lean and green practices are discussed.</p>

                <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
                <p>Upon completion of IndT 457 course, the students will:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Have an in-depth understanding of lean manufacturing principles.</li>
                    <li>Be able to apply lean principles to a variety of manufacturing processes.</li>
                    <li>Identify the advantages and limitations of applying lean principles.</li>
                    <li>Be conversant on energy efficient building design.</li>
                    <li>Be able to describe trade-offs inherent to implementing green technologies.</li>
                </ol>

                <h3>Course Materials</h3>
                <p><strong>Textbook: </strong>A. Brophy, "<em>FT Guide to Lean: How to Streamline Your Organization, Engage Employees and Create a Competitive Edge</em>," Pearson, 2012 (ISBN-10: 0273770500, ISBN-13: 978-0273770503).</p>

                <h3>Topics</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Introduction</li>
                    <li>Lean Strategy Deployment</li>
                    <li>Value Stream Mapping</li>
                    <li>Idea Management System</li>
                    <li>Methods and Tools</li>
                    <li>Energy Efficient Building Design</li>
                    <li>Lean Culture</li>
                    <li>Sustaining Lean</li>
                    <li>Lean Roadmap</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Evaluation Procedure</h3>
                <p>The course is delivered in a "hybrid" format, with alternating weekly live course sessions and on-line interactions through BbLearn. The learning objectives are met by applying lean and green principles in a course project, reviewing the literature, and reporting on the advantages and disadvantages of the lean paradigm. Participation in all class meetings is expected. A minimum of six blog postings are required. The students submit a midterm paper, based on a literature review regarding the advantages and disadvantages of applying lean principles in work processes. For the final project, the students identify lean and green opportunities, and develop recommendations for potential practices and methods that could be applied to improve the studied process.</p>
