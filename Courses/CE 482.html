                <h3>Evaluation Procedure</h3>
                <p>The course is delivered in a "web-based" format. Course materials, related to lecture notes, presentations, assignments, and supplementary materials, are posted on BbLearn on a regular basis. The students are responsible to actively participate by regularly logging in on BbLearn, reading the posted materials, and completing the assignments in a timely manner. There are 8 assignments in total. All the assignments carry equal weight toward the final grade. The course is project-based, therefore the course does not have exams, and instead the emphasis in assessing the students' knowledge is on a course project.</p>
