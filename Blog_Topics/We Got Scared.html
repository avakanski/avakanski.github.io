                <h2>We Got Scared</h2>
                <p class="post-date"><em>Posted March 2015</em></p>

                <p>This blog is just about a video that I liked, and I decided to share. The title of the video is "We got scared". It has an interesting narrative, which goes over compiled footage from different movies.</p>

                <p>Here is the link to the 8:40 minutes video.</p>

                <p>The topic is about our human nature, our fears of the unknown, and our inability to completely understand the world around us and our place in it.</p>

                <p>The narrative has two opposing parts. The first part talks about our evolution from primitive animals into intelligent beings. Despite our intellectual growth, we are still fear-driven, we haven't overcome prejudices, and we have spent so much of our potential and creativity into inventing weapons and ways to kill each other. The second part has a more optimistic note, and discusses our progress and achievements as a species. We have evolved intellectually, we have discovered many of nature's secrets, and we have reached our moon and other planets with our sophisticated tools. The concluding thoughts are that we should learn to live in peace with each other, as a society we need to share the resources and the knowledge, and we need to focus on creating a better life for every person on the planet.</p>
