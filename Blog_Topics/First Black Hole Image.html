                <h2>First Black Hole Image</h2>
                <p class="post-date"><em>Posted October 2020</em></p>

                <p>In 2019, a global team of researchers created the first-ever image of a black hole. Like in the popular joke 'How many people does it take to do X,' how many researchers do you think it took to create that first image of a black hole? The answer is 347 researchers (a subgroup of the team is shown below), which speaks volumes of the challenges, required expertise, and efforts to produce the image.</p>

                <p>We will get to the image in a moment, but first, the very term 'black hole' is a little misleading. 'Hole' implies an empty area, void of any matter. On the opposite, 'black holes' are large and very dense astronomical bodies, often many times larger than the Sun. Even light cannot escape the gravitational field of such bodies, and as a result, they appear black and invisible to our telescopes. Until recently, the existence of black holes was just a theoretical hypothesis outlined in the General Theory of Relativity (by Albert Einstein, of course).</p>

                <p>The image shows the black hole at the center of Messier 87, a massive galaxy in the nearby Virgo galaxy cluster. It is located 55 million light-years from Earth and has a mass 6.5 billion times that of the Sun. The image shows a bright ring formed as light bends in the intense gravity around a black hole that is 6.5 billion times more massive than the Sun.</p>

                <p>The image was captured by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), a network of eight ground-based radio telescopes located across the globe. The EHT links telescopes around the globe to form an Earth-sized virtual telescope with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution. The telescopes contributing to this result were ALMA, APEX, the IRAM 30-meter telescope, the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, the Large Millimeter Telescope Alfonso Serrano, the Submillimeter Array, the Submillimeter Telescope, and the South Pole Telescope. The telescopes work together using a technique called very-long-baseline interferometry (VLBI). This synchronizes telescope facilities around the world and exploits the rotation of our planet to form one huge, Earth-size telescope observing at a wavelength of 1.3mm. VLBI allows the EHT to achieve an angular resolution of 20 micro-arcseconds — enough to read a newspaper in New York from a sidewalk café in Paris.</p>

                <p>The construction of the image was an extraordinary challenge. The EHT team had to develop new methods to calibrate and combine the data. While the telescopes are not physically connected, their data is combined by timing their observations precisely using atomic clocks. The data collected by the telescopes was stored on hard drives and flown to central processing centers in Boston, US, and Bonn, Germany. The data was then processed using supercomputers to recover the image.</p>

                <p>The image confirms Einstein's theory of general relativity near the event horizon of a black hole. It shows a bright ring surrounding a dark region, which is consistent with the predicted shadow of a black hole. The ring is brighter on one side because the black hole is rotating, and thus material on the side of the black hole turning toward Earth appears brighter as it moves at close to the speed of light.</p>

                <p>This first image of a black hole is a significant small step toward unveiling the mysteries of the universe.</p>
